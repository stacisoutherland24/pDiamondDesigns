              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
               For company founder Kerry Pryor, the decision to launch her own western jewelry and accessories company was a natural
               progression following many successful years as a western apparel sales rep, loving both the business and the people in it.
              <p>
               Wanting to create abusiness in which she and her father could work together, the decision was made to use the Pryor family's 
               "P Diamond" horse brand as her company name, honoring her family's heritage and Oklahoma roots dating back to the 1800s.
